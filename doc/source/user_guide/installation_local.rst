Installation on a local computer
--------------------------------

The recommended approach is to install optimas in a ``conda`` environment.

Install ``mpi4py``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If your system has already an MPI implementation installed, install ``mpi4py``
using ``pip``:

.. code::

    pip install mpi4py

This will make sure that optimas uses the existing MPI. The recommended
MPI implementation is MPICH.

If you don't have an existing MPI installation, the recommended approach is to
install ``mpi4py`` from ``conda``, including the MPI implementation corresponding
to your operating system.

On Linux and macOS:

.. code::

    conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py mpich

On Windows:

.. code::

    conda install -c conda-forge mpi4py msmpi

Install optimas from PyPI (recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will install the latest stable release.

Installing with only the **basic** dependencies:

.. code::

    pip install optimas

Installing with **all** dependencies:

.. code::

    pip install 'optimas[all]'

Use this option if you plan to do Bayesian optimization
(see :ref:`dependencies` for more details).

Install from conda-forge
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    conda install optimas --channel conda-forge

Install from GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will install the latest development version with all dependencies.

.. code::

    pip install "optimas[all] @ git+https://github.com/optimas-org/optimas.git"
